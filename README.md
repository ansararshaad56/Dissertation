Title: Cyberbullying Detection on Social Media using Machine Learning with Bag of Words (BoW)

Description:
This GitHub repository showcases a practical approach to cyberbullying detection on social media using machine learning, specifically leveraging the Bag of Words (BoW) technique.
Developed as part of a dissertation project, this project demonstrates how to preprocess social media data, create feature vectors using BoW, and apply machine learning algorithms
to achieve accurate cyberbullying detection.

Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Access code and tools for cleaning and preprocessing social media text data to prepare it for analysis.

Bag of Words (BoW): Understand how to implement the BoW technique to convert text data into numerical feature vectors, capturing the frequency of words within the dataset.

Labeling Dataset: Learn how to label the dataset, distinguishing between cyberbullying and non-cyberbullying instances for supervised learning.

Machine Learning Algorithms: Explore the application of various machine learning algorithms such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), Random Forest, and Naive Bayes for cyberbullying detection.

Training and Evaluation: Train machine learning models using the BoW-transformed data and evaluate their performance using appropriate evaluation metrics.

Optimization: Discover techniques for hyperparameter tuning and model optimization to enhance detection accuracy.

Result Analysis: Analyze the results and gain insights into the effectiveness of BoW-based cyberbullying detection.

Documentation: Access clear and concise documentation explaining the methodology, code usage, and results achieved.

By providing this GitHub repository, we offer a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners interested in cyberbullying detection using the Bag of Words approach. 
This project demonstrates a fundamental yet effective technique for addressing online harassment and promotes safer digital environments. Feel free to explore, contribute, 
and adapt this project for your specific needs or research goals.
